name: Build and upload to PyPI

# Build on every branch push, tag push, and pull request change:
#on: [push, pull_request]
# Alternatively, to publish when a (published) GitHub Release is created, use the following:
on:
    push:
    pull_request:
    release:
        types:
            - published
