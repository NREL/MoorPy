# start of a script to hold the functions that hold the mooring line and anchor property info

    ''' getLineProps version 3.2: Restructuring v3.1 to 'Orcaflex-original' and 'Orcaflex-altered' 
    
    Motivation: The existing public, and NREL-internal references for mooring line component property
    data are either proprietary, or unreliable and incomplete. The best way to derive new equations
    as a function of diameter is to use data from mooring line manufacturer's catalogs. Once developed,
    these new equations will serve as an updated version to compare against existing expressions.
    
    The goal is to have NREL's own library of mooring line property equations, but more research is needed.
    The original Orcaflex equations are the best we have right now and have been altered to include
    a quadratic chain MBL equation rather than a cubic, to avoid negative MBLs.
    Also, different cost models are put in to the altered version to avoid the Equimar data. Many sources
    researched for cost data, coefficients used are close to the old NREL internal data, but still an approximation.
    
    For more info, see the Mooring Component Properties Word doc.

    - This function requires at least one input: the line diameter in millimeters.
    - The rest of the inputs are optional: describe the desired type of line (chain, polyester, wire, etc.),
    the type of chain (studless or studlink), the source of data (Orcaflex-original or altered), or a name identifier
    - The function will output a MoorPy linetype object
