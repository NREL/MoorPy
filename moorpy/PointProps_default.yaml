# THIS IS IN PROGRESS

# Default point properties with cost curves based on work presented in OMAE2025-156384
# The following is YAML syntax and follows a heirarchy of

# PointProps -> [point type name] -> [number and size of components]
# ConnectProps -> [connection component name] -> [component coefficients]

# All possible ConnectProps coefficients are as follows:
    # mass      :     # mass offset [kg]
    # mass_d    :     # mass as a function of nominal size (bar diameter) [kg/m]  NOT YET FULLY SUPPORTED
    # vol       :     # volume offset [m^3]
    # v_d       :     # volume as a function of nominal size [m^3/m]  NOT YET FULLY SUPPORTED
    # MBL       :     # MBL offset [kN] NOT YET FULLY SUPPORTED
    # MBL_m     :     # minimum breaking load per mass [kN/kg] NOT YET FULLY SUPPORTED
    # cost_MBL  :     # cost per MBL [$/kN]
    # cost_MBL2 :     # cost per MBL^2 [$/kN^2]
    # cost_MBL3 :     # cost per MBL^3 [$/kN^3]
    # cost_b    :     # cost per buoyancy [$/kN]
    # cost_b2   :     # cost per buoyancy^2 [$/kN^2]
    # cost_b3   :     # cost per buoyancy^3 [$/kN^3]
    # cost      :     # baseline cost offset [$]

# All possible PointProps coefficients are as follows:
    # num_<connect name>:   # number of this connection type where <connect name> matches the name of a ConnectProps entry (case sensistive). If no value is give num of component is assumed zero
    # con_mbl          :   # nominal size of component (a number) or automatically size based on attached line size (-1 flag)
    # buoyancy          :   # the size of any buoys in this connection type [kN]
    # cost              :   # cost to overwrite the calculated cost [$]
    # mass              :   # mass to overwrite the calculated mass [kg]
    # volume            :   # volume to overwrite the calculated volume [m^3]
    # mbl               :   # mbl to overwrite the calculated volume [kN]
