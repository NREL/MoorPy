MoorPy
=======

MoorPy is an open-source quasi-static mooring toolset that can be used for a 
variety of mooring system applications. It is under ongoing development at NREL
and publicly available under an open-source license at `github.com/NREL/MoorPy <https://github.com/NREL/MoorPy>`_.

See the pages on this site for information about the operation, usage, and theory of MoorPy. 


Overview
--------

MoorPy is a quasi-static mooring model and a suite of associated functions for mooring 
system analysis. The core model supports quasi-static analysis of moored floating systems 
including any arrangement of mooring lines and floating platforms. It solves the distributed 
position and tension of each mooring line segment using standard catenary equations. 
Floating platforms can be represented with linear hydrostatic characteristics. MoorPy 
automatically computes a floating system's equilibrium state and can be queried to identify 
a mooring system's nonlinear force-displacement relationships. Linearized stiffness matrices 
are efficiently computed using semi-analytic Jacobians. MoorPy also includes plotting 
functions and a library of mooring component property and cost coefficients. MoorPy can 
be used directly from Python scripts to perform mooring design and analysis tasks, or it can 
be coupled with other tools to compute quasi-static mooring reactions as part of a larger 
simulation.
